This was a [Data Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/fall-2018-stat-441841-data-challenge-1)done as part of University of Waterloo STAT 441 : Statistical Learning - Classification class. Using the data set borrowed from [Fashion MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist/data) the aim was to predict the label for each id in the test set.
